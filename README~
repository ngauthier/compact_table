CompactTable
============

CompactTable was created to solve the problem of displaying the index page for a complicated
object with many fields. Often, these fields run over the width of the page. CompactTable allows
the user to specify two classes of html code. The first, to be shown by default, and the second
which only displays when the user clicks a link.

When you install this plugin, make sure to copy the css and js files to the public/stylesheets and
public/javascripts folders.


Example
=======

Lets say we have a model, People, and this is app/views/people/index.html.erb.

<% compact_table({:collection => @people, :identifier => 'people_', :lambda_toggle_link => lambda { |person| -%>
  <%= h person.name %>
  <% }, :lambda_displayed => lambda { |person| -%>
  <span class="compact_table_left">
    <%= h person.age %>
  </span>
  <span class="compact_table_right">
    <%= h person.alive? %>
  </span>
<% } , :lambda_hidden => lambda { |exercise| -%>
  <h3>About me</h3>
  <%= person.about %>
<% }}) -%>

The first lambda (lambda_toggle_link) defines what the text for the link that opens and closes the
table will be.

The second lambda (lambda_displayed) shows the displayed information. The CSS classes for left and
right just define float status for you so that some text is aligned on the left and some on the
right.

The third lambda (lambda_hidden) is the data that will be hidden until the user clicks
lambda_toggle_link.
